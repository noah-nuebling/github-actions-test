Inspiration / Apps I **stole** from:

- [SteerMouse](https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/index.html) - The OG mouse software for Mac. Inspiration for many features. I often thought "this is is probably not possible" but then I saw "oh SteerMouse does it" and then 3 years later I figured out how to do it, too.
- [Calftrail Touch](https://github.com/calftrail/Touch) - Basis for "reverse engineering" work powering MMFs best-in-class and first-of-a-kind touch simulation!
- [SensibleSideButtons](https://github.com/archagon/sensible-side-buttons) - Basis for early implementation of Back and Forward feature. Made me find Calftrail Touch?
- [SmoothMouse](https://smoothmouse.com/) - It's creator [Dae](https://dae.me/) answered some important questions for me about Pointer Speed
