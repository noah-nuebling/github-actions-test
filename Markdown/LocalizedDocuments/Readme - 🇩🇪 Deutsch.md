Make Mouse Fix is the most powerful, streamlined, optimized ...

Mac Mouse Fix is a driver for regular third party mice that aims to be at the same level of quality and integration with macOS as Apples native Trackpad drivers. 

It also aims to bring very powerful customization options to your mouse while still being extremly easy to use. 

My goal is to make Mac Mouse Fix the best mouse driver of all time. Currently it's still lacking some features, but I think it already offers the best implementation of the features which it does have. 

?? Mac Mouse Fix I want to make the best mouse driver ever! I think it's pretty gewd already. ?? Mac Mouse Fix I want to make the best mouse driver ever! I think it's pretty gewd already.??

<!-- This is a macOS app for the [`gifski` encoder](https://gif.ski), which converts videos to GIF animations using [`pngquant`](https://pngquant.org)'s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame and up to 50 FPS (useful for showing off design work on Dribbble).

You can also produce smaller lower quality GIFs when needed with the ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù slider, thanks to [`gifsicle`](https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle).

Gifski supports all the video formats that macOS supports (`.mp4` or `.mov` with H264, HEVC, ProRes, etc). The [QuickTime Animation format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_Animation) is not supported. Use [ProRes 4444 XQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProRes) instead. It's more efficient, more widely supported, and like QuickTime Animation, it also supports alpha channel.

Gifski has a bunch of settings like changing dimensions, speed, frame rate, quality, looping, and more. -->

## Features

Header Ideas: Mouse Gestures done right, major boost to productivity, ??meunu bar item, ?trackpad-like scrolling

### Do the things you do on a Trackpad, without a Trackpad!

- Default config lets you do everything you do on Trackpad!
  - Move between Spaces, Open Mission Control or App Expos√©, Open Launchpad, Show the desktop, Look up words, Quick Look files in the Finder, go back and forwards in apps like Safari, Zoom in and out on the Web and elsewhere, use smartzoom, 360 degree free scrolling for pro apps.
  - All using 2 buttons in a simple and intuitive setup - just as easy and fun and responsive as trackpad!
- Click and Drag Gestures + Click and Scroll Gestures - feels super great
- (If you're using 3 button mouse won't be quite as powerful)

### Smooth, Responsive Scrolling

- Feels great. Easy to control.

## Questions

**Native on Apple Silicon?**

Yes. 

(Lots of apps advertise with this but it's kind of an "of course" thing. This should also probs be under features or sth not questions?)

**Does Mac Mouse Fix track my information?**

I'm committed to your privacy. Mac Mouse Fix does not have ads and it doesn't track any information about you. 
If you have automatic updates turned on, Mac Mouse Fix will ping Github's servers every time you launch the app to ask for an update. I can't retrieve any information about that however.

**Is Mac Mouse Fix compatible with the Apple Magic Mouse?**

Mac Mouse Fix currently has no effect on the Apple Magic Mouse. Maybe I will add features in the future which work with the Magic Mouse.

**Is my Logitech / Razor Mouse compatible?**

Yes but some buttons might not work properly because poopoo custom protocol + onboard memory.

Same is true for Glorious, ?Steelseries

I want to add this but it's not coming soon!!

You can use SteerMouse or proprietary driver like Logitech Options instead.

**Can I use tilting wheel for buttons?**

No you dumbo

**Pointer Speedd / Turn off acceleration??**

Not yet, but here are alternatives <...>. Adding it soon and !! (I hope) (and better than everyone else hehe)

**Click delay**

When you click, MMF will wait to see if you're going to double click. Delete the "Double Click" Action to remove the delay. More info here.

**Blender Compatibility**

If you have actions mapped to middle button, use Scroll and navigate (or Click and drag sim?) to still navigate in Blender. Or uncapture Middle button (maybe make this a guide on its own?)

**Will Mac Mouse Fix still be Open Source now that it's monetized?**

Yes. Mac Mouse Fix will still be open source, and I don't plan to change that at any point.

This also means you can use Mac Mouse Fix for free by building it from source and disabling the licensing checks. That's perfectly fine, I just discourage sharing these cracked versions online.
And of course, on the next update, you'll get a non-cracked version which means you'll have to do this again for every update. (Or just pay $1.99 for the greatest mouse driver ever! :)

Anyone will also still be able to use source code from Mac Mouse Fix in their free and commercial products as long as they don't just sell a copy of Mac Mouse Fix without adding their own contribution.

Learn about the details in the new MMF License which MMF 3 will be licensed under.

**Can I get Mac Mouse Fix for free if I already donated?**

Yes! If you bought me a milkshake before the 10th of September 2022, you can write an email to noah.n.public@gmail.com with "Milkshake Karma" in the subject and a screenshot as proof and then I'll send you a 100% off discount code or something!

## What people say

These cool articles were written about MMF

- That YouTube video (so sick)
- Lifehacker
- Blib blob (Japanese)
- Not CNET review
- (?If you know about other coverage of MMF let me know?)

These are great compliments that I / Mac Mouse Fix have received from users. They made me smile and they made my crippling self esteem issues a little better:

- "God Among Men" - Guy on Stackexchange
- ... Some comments about how people love it and how it's the best app of it's kind and so on!
-  (Not complete by any means! Thanks to everythingn who wrote something nice!!)

## Tips

**Brightness, Volume, and Media controls right from your mouse!**

MMF Let's you use any key on your keyboard directly from your mouse.
Even keys only found on Apple keyboards like 'Increase Brightness', 'Decrease Volume' or 'Play-Pause'. 

If you don't have Apple Keyboard at hand, hold Option (‚å•) to reveal the Apple-Keyboard exclusive keys in a dropdown menu!

<img src="../../Markdown/Media/Apple-Keys-Demo.gif" width="450">

You can also use keyboard shorcuts to do anything from your mouse by hooking into other stuff like Apple Shortcuts!

P sick right?

**Use Swish to manage your windows**

[Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) is my favorite way to snap windows (/ get window snapping / manage windows on macOS). It lets you position any window so it takes up half, a quarter, or the whole screen with a single swipe on your trackpad, making it much easier to work with many windows at once. 

It's designed for trackpad gestures, but with Mac Mouse Fix you can use it from any third-party mouse!

Just set any button's Click & Drag action to Scroll & Navigate and you can snap windows with a simple click and drag

In fact you can use any app or macOS system feature that works by swiping with two fingers using the "Scroll & Navigate" option! That

You can also simulate 2 finger swipes from the scrollwheel by enabling "Trackpad Gestures" under the Scroll Tab (only visible if you set Smoothness to High).

Copied from 3.0.0 Beta 1 Release notes

((I plan to write a more detailed guide on this in the future)), but if you want to give it a go, here's a small overview of the steps:

- **Download** the source code & Xcode
- [Add your language](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-support-for-languages-and-regions) to the project
- Put your translations into the `.strings` and `.stringsdict` files throughout the project
- **Commit** your changes and create a pull request

If your translation is added to the project you'll get **10 MMF copies for free**, and of course, you'll be **credited as a contributor**. I heard you can also leave your **personal message** by changing some of the (secret rare thank you messages) on the About tab.

Maybe I'll add **more perks** in the future. Let me know if you have any **ideas** for that!

### Give feedback

You can help by sharing your **ideas**, **issues** and **feedback**!

The best place to share your **ideas** and **issues** is the [Feedback Assistant](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/mac-mouse-fix-feedback-assistant/?type=bug-report).
The best place to give **quick** unstructured feedback is the [Feedback Discussion](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/366).

You can also access both these places from within the app on the "**‚ìò About**" tab.

### Contribute code

I'll be happy about any pull requests! Hope my code isn't too terrible heh. 

## License
