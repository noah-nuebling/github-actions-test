## 👾 Other Software

__Apps__ that inspired Mac Mouse Fix:

- [SteerMouse](https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/index.html) - The OG mouse software for Mac. Inspiration for many features. I often thought "this is is probably not possible" but then I saw "oh SteerMouse does it" and then 3 years later I figured out how to do it, too.
- [Calftrail Touch](https://github.com/calftrail/Touch) - Basis for "reverse engineering" work powering MMFs best-in-class and first-of-a-kind touch simulation!
- [SensibleSideButtons](https://github.com/archagon/sensible-side-buttons) - Basis for early implementation of Back and Forward feature. Made me find Calftrail Touch?
- [SmoothMouse](https://smoothmouse.com/) - It's creator [Dae](https://dae.me/) answered some important questions for me about Pointer Speed 
- [Gifski by sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Gifski) - Greatly inspired the Mac Mouse Fix README.md
- MOS - Inertial Scrolling feel, App-Specific Settings Implementation and more were inspired by the MOS

__People__ that inspired Mac Mouse Fix:

- @DrJume for teaching me about debouncing and inspiring the UI for entering and displaying keyboard modifiers on the scroll tab
- German guy for inspiring the tab-based layout in MMF 3
- Guy who helped tune the fast scrolling in that pull request
- So many others I can't think of right now. Thanks to everybody else who shared their thoughts!
