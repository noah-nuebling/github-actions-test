- HTTP basics: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_requests.htm
  - Abstraction stack is IP (Packets and routing) -> TCP ('Correct' streams or chunks of data (aka files?)) -> HTTP (Made for webbrowser<->server connection but now also used for other communication)
  - HTTP requests are basically a string of text following a certain format (aka protocol) and then transmitted via TCP.
  - HTTP requests seems to be built around "forms". But all the stuff with "form" in it's name is now also used for other stuff.
    - See: https://eloquentjavascript.net/18_http.html <- This article is great
  - HTTP requests consist of
    - Request line containing METHOD, URI, and HTTP version
      - IIUC the server can map any METHOD to any action. METHODs don't 'do' anything. It's just convention that certain methods trigger certain types of actions.
      - URI specifies "the resource upon which to act". It's bascally the URL without the ?name=value part (aka the Query String). Can also be * for the whole server or a path relative to the server where the request originated. But that's not relevant for us.
    - Optional header(s)
      - These are just random key-value-pairs whose keys are conventionally used and therefore *probably* understood by the receiver
    - Optional body
      - This can be any data in any format. These are the 2 conventionally used formats which can be specified in the header with key "Content-Type":
        - application/x-www-form-urlencoded
          - Data is encoded to look like the queryString (key=value&key2=value2).
          - This is the default and most commonly used.
        - multipart/form-data
          - Body can have several sections all with different headers and encodings. I often read "use this when your form has file uploads"
      - There are also more formats like "application/json", or plaintext. 
      - I think the urlencoded can transmit nested datastructures somehow but not sure.
      - When your url contains a queryString the query string will automatically be made part of the body of the HTTP request (True for POST, not true for GET. Not sure about other METHODS)
        - So do you have to use application/x-www-form-urlencoded when using a queryString?
        - Can you use a queryString and also send additional data? That would probably use `multipart/form-data`.
  - IIUC HTTP is designed for transferring old, static, javascriptless HTML between servers and web browsers. Here, the only method of interaction was forms and links. That's where a lot of the weirdness comes from. Using HTTP Post for general message sending to/from/between servers is also kind of weird, since it has nothing to do with "HyperText" at all. HTTP just became became the standard for all these things it was never designed for. That's why it's so weird.
- TCP ports seem to be pretty unnecessary. I think ports were originally made to allow for simultaneous connection sessions, but there can be several connection sessions on a single TCP port. Port numbers are conventionally used for specific higher level protocols (e.g. port 80 for HTTP). But I feel like everything would work fine if ports didn't exist.
