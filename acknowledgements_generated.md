## Other software 👾

Inspiration / Apps I **stole** from:

- [SteerMouse](https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/index.html) - The OG mouse software for Mac. Inspiration for many features. I often thought "this is is probably not possible" but then I saw "oh SteerMouse does it" and then 3 years later I figured out how to do it, too.
- [Calftrail Touch](https://github.com/calftrail/Touch) - Basis for "reverse engineering" work powering MMFs best-in-class and first-of-a-kind touch simulation!
- [SensibleSideButtons](https://github.com/archagon/sensible-side-buttons) - Basis for early implementation of Back and Forward feature. Made me find Calftrail Touch?
- [SmoothMouse](https://smoothmouse.com/) - It's creator [Dae](https://dae.me/) answered some important questions for me about Pointer Speed 
- [Gifski by sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Gifski) - Greatly inspired the Mac Mouse Fix README.md
- MOS - Inertial Scrolling feel, App-Specific Settings Implementation and more were inspired by the MOS
- 


Mac Mouse Fix was built with the help of these **great libraries**:

- [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) - Streams of values over time. Tailored for Swift.
- [CocoaLumberjack](https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack) - Fast & simple, yet powerful & flexible logging
- [Swift Markdown](https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown) - Parse, build, edit, and analyze Markdown documents
- [BartyCrouch](https://github.com/FlineDev/BartyCrouch) - Keep translation files in sync with Source Code and Interface Builder files
- [Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle) - A software update framework for macOS
- [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) - Making Auto Layout easy on both iOS and OS X
- [MASShortcut](https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut) - API and user interface for recording, storing and using system-wide keyboard shortcuts -> Using this to display keyboard keys in the UI.
- [CGSInternal](https://github.com/NUIKit/CGSInternal) - A collection of private CoreGraphics routines -> used for all sorts of stuff Mac Mouse Fix does.
