<!-- This is a macOS app for the [`gifski` encoder](https://gif.ski), which converts videos to GIF animations using [`pngquant`](https://pngquant.org)'s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame and up to 50 FPS (useful for showing off design work on Dribbble).

You can also produce smaller lower quality GIFs when needed with the “Quality” slider, thanks to [`gifsicle`](https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle).

Gifski supports all the video formats that macOS supports (`.mp4` or `.mov` with H264, HEVC, ProRes, etc). The [QuickTime Animation format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_Animation) is not supported. Use [ProRes 4444 XQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProRes) instead. It's more efficient, more widely supported, and like QuickTime Animation, it also supports alpha channel.

Gifski has a bunch of settings like changing dimensions, speed, frame rate, quality, looping, and more. -->

## FAQ

**Does Mac Mouse Fix track your information?**

I'm committed to your privacy. Mac Mouse Fix does not have ads and it doesn't track any information about you. 
If you have automatic updates turned on, Mac Mouse Fix will ping Github's servers every time you launch the app to ask for an update. I can't retrieve any information about that however.

**Is Mac Mouse Fix compatible with the Apple Magic Mouse?**

Mac Mouse Fix currently has no effect on the Apple Magic Mouse. Maybe I will add features in the future which work with the Magic Mouse.

**Click delay**

When you click, MMF will wait to see if you're going to double click. Delete the "Double Click" Action to remove the delay. More info here.
